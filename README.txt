The company has a problem of low rates in satisfaction with customer service. Many clients allege that the service is slow and that the agents are not trained to provide a good solution
to their problems, turning to other agents to consult or taking a long time to run tests on the software, which delays the service time.  


## The goals of the project are:

* Identify the strenghs of each agent, evaluating previous inquiries.
* Classify the most frequent inquiries received by telephone or email in order to automatically identify the best agent to attend to the inquiry.
